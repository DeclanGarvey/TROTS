# TROTS
#
# The Radiotherapy Optimisation Test Set (TROTS) is an extensive set 
# of problems originating from radiation therapy treatment planning.
#
# To start you up, some basic scripts are provided to work with the 
# data. While the dataset itself is static, scripts are subjected to
# improvement.
